<!-- # what i learned while making react app

- jsx
- components
- useState hook
- samll db
- onclick
- onchange
- view === user interface
- VISER : view -> event -> state -> render 
- callback fucntions
- style as an object
- input ==> processing ==> ouput
- Using the right data structure for needs would help in making access and update faster
- converting object to array 

## need to learn 
- map()
- callback in map 
- onClick for any item, it show which item was clicked from the list
- syntax: onClick={() => emojiClickHandler(emoji)} -->
